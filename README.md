# VIZ
A lightweight package (HTML, CSS, and JS) that reads a tab-delimited table of academic requirements by program and dynamically generates a webpage to search them.

VIZ uses the jQuery Toggles plugin (https://github.com/simontabor/jquery-toggles) and is built on the Skeleton responsive design framework (https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton). For correct display, both of these packages must be accessible to VIZ. Installation instructions can be found at the links provided.
